# Task Status - 3D Gomoku AI Implementation

## âœ… Task 1: Implement Forbidden Move Rules (COMPLETED)

**Summary:** Successfully implemented the six-in-a-row forbidden move rule while allowing open 3-3 patterns.

**What was implemented:**
- Created `src/utils/gameRules.ts` with comprehensive move validation functions
- `isForbiddenMove()` - Checks if a move would create six consecutive stones in any of the 26 3D directions
- `isLegalMove()` - Validates moves are within bounds, on empty positions, and not forbidden
- `getLegalMoves()` - Returns all legal moves for a player (useful for AI)
- `countConsecutiveStones()` - Helper function for pattern evaluation (AI heuristics)

**Integration points:**
- Modified `App.tsx` to import and use forbidden move validation
- Added validation to `handlePlaceStone()` function before placing stones
- Added validation to ghost stone placement to prevent illegal previews
- Maintained existing game flow while adding rule enforcement

**Testing:** 
- Code compiles without linter errors
- Forbidden move logic prevents six-in-a-row in all 26 directions
- Open 3-3 patterns are allowed as specified
- Game maintains smooth user experience with console logging for debugging

## âœ… Task 2: Add Game Mode Selection (COMPLETED)

**Summary:** Successfully implemented color selection screen and game state management for Human vs AI gameplay.

**What was implemented:**
- Created `src/components/GameSetup.tsx` with beautiful color selection interface
- Added game mode state management: `gameMode: 'setup' | 'playing'`
- Added player configuration: `humanPlayer`, `aiPlayer`, `isAiThinking` state
- Updated App.tsx to show setup screen before game starts
- Added `handlePlayerSelection()` to configure human/AI player assignments
- Updated restart functionality to return to setup screen

**UI/UX Features:**
- Elegant color selection with 3D stone previews
- Clear game rules explanation
- Responsive design matching existing theme system
- Smooth transitions between setup and game modes
- Updated title to "3D Gomoku vs AI" during gameplay

**Integration points:**

## âœ… Task 3: AI Integration Points (COMPLETED)

**Summary:** Successfully integrated AI state management and modified game flow to support Human vs AI gameplay with proper turn management.

**What was implemented:**
- Modified `handlePlaceStone()` to only allow human player moves via UI
- Created `placeStoneOnBoard()` centralized function for both human and AI moves
- Added `makeAiMove()` function with 0.5-second thinking delay (placeholder AI logic)
- Implemented AI move triggering after human moves
- Added logic for AI to make first move when playing as black
- Updated turn indicator to show AI thinking state and human/AI context

**Game Flow Changes:**
- Human moves trigger AI response after 100ms delay for smooth transition
- AI moves bypass ghost stone system (direct placement)
- AI thinking state prevents human interaction during AI turn
- Proper turn switching between human and AI players
- AI makes first move automatically when selected as black

**UI/UX Improvements:**
- Turn indicator shows "Your Turn" vs "AI Turn" vs "AI is thinking..."
- Win messages show "You Win!" vs "AI Wins!" with appropriate emojis
- Smooth transitions between human and AI moves
- AI thinking state provides clear feedback to user

**Technical Integration:**
- AI state management fully integrated with existing game logic
- Placeholder random AI ready to be replaced with actual minimax algorithm
- All existing features (undo, restart, sound, etc.) work with AI integration
- Clean separation between human and AI move handling

## âœ… Task 4: Heuristic Evaluation Function (COMPLETED)

**Summary:** Implemented comprehensive 3D pattern evaluation with weighted direction priorities for strategic AI advantage.

**What was implemented:**
- Created `src/ai/heuristic.ts` with sophisticated pattern analysis
- Direction classification: Main axes (1.0x), Face diagonals (0.8x), Space diagonals (1.2x weight)
- Pattern scoring: Win (1M), Four-open (10K), Three-open (500), Two-open (50), etc.
- Threat evaluation: Detects opponent winning moves and blocks them
- Positional bonuses: Center positions get higher strategic value
- `evaluatePosition()` main function and `quickEvaluateMove()` for move ordering

**Strategic Features:**
- 3D pattern recognition across all 26 directions
- Weighted evaluation gives AI advantage in space diagonals (hardest for humans)
- Threat detection prevents opponent wins
- Center-focused positional play
- Optimized for both accuracy and performance

## âœ… Task 5: Move Generation & Ordering (COMPLETED)

**Summary:** Implemented intelligent move generation and ordering system for efficient alpha-beta pruning.

**What was implemented:**
- Created `src/ai/moveGeneration.ts` with multiple move generation strategies
- `generateOrderedMoves()` - Smart move ordering based on position evaluation
- `generateLocalMoves()` - Focused search around existing stones
- `KillerMoveTable` - Tracks moves that cause alpha-beta cutoffs
- Move ordering: Center positions first, proximity to stones, killer moves

**Optimization Features:**
- Game phase detection (early/mid/late game strategies)
- Local vs global move generation based on board state
- Killer move heuristic for better pruning
- Proximity scoring for tactical play
- Configurable move limits for performance control

---

## âœ… Task 6: Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning (COMPLETED)

**Summary:** Implemented core AI decision-making engine with advanced search optimizations.

**What was implemented:**
- Created `src/ai/minimax.ts` with full minimax algorithm
- Alpha-beta pruning for efficient search tree traversal
- Iterative deepening for better time management
- Time-limited search with 400ms default limit
- Killer move integration and move ordering
- Game phase adaptive search (different depths for early/mid/late game)

**Advanced Features:**
- Iterative deepening starts shallow and goes deeper
- Time management prevents search timeout
- Win/loss detection with depth preference (faster wins preferred)
- Adaptive move generation based on board state
- Search statistics tracking (nodes evaluated, depth reached)

## âœ… Bug Fix: TypeScript Compilation Errors (COMPLETED)

**Summary:** Fixed TypeScript compilation errors that were preventing the application from building.

**Issues Fixed:**
- **moveGeneration.ts**: Fixed `Set<string>` iteration by using `Array.from(localPositions)`
- **GameSetup.tsx**: Fixed styled-components theme prop typing by adding `<{ theme: any }>` to all styled components
- All TypeScript errors resolved, build now compiles successfully

**Technical Details:**
- TypeScript was strict about iterating over `Set<string>` - converted to array first
- Styled-components needed explicit theme prop typing for TypeScript compatibility
- Production build now compiles cleanly with only harmless source map warnings from dependencies
